# Variables and data types 

## Things you should know before declaring variables in Go
- In Go, variables are explicitly declared and used by the compiler. 
- `var` or `const` declares 1 or more variables.
- `var` can change its value overtime but it can't change its type.
- `const` can't change its value nor its type.
- Go will infer the type of initialized variables.
- Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are zero-valued.
- The := syntax is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable. This syntax is only available inside functions.

## Data types in Go
`int` is used to declare integers.
`float32` is used to declare 32-bit floating numbers.
`float64` is used to declare 64-bit floating numbers.
`string` is used to declare strings.
`bool` is used to declare boolean values.
